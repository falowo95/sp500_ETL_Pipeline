                should not be set.
            environment (google.cloud.orchestration.airflow.service_v1.types.Environment):

                ``updateMask`` will be copied from the patch environment
                into the environment under update.

                This corresponds to the ``environment`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            update_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
                Required. A comma-separated list of paths, relative to
                ``Environment``, of fields to update. For example, to
                set the version of scikit-learn to install in the
                environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing
                installation of numpy, the ``updateMask`` parameter
                would include the following two ``paths`` values:
                "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and
                "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy". The included
                patch environment would specify the scikit-learn version
                as follows:

                ::

                    {
                      "config":{
                        "softwareConfig":{
                          "pypiPackages":{
                            "scikit-learn":"==0.19.0"
                          }
                        }
                      }
                    }

                Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI
                packages other than scikit-learn and numpy will be
                unaffected.

                Only one update type may be included in a single
                request's ``updateMask``. For example, one cannot update
                both the PyPI packages and labels in the same request.
                However, it is possible to update multiple members of a
                map field simultaneously in the same request. For
                example, to set the labels "label1" and "label2" while
                clearing "label3" (assuming it already exists), one can
                provide the paths "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and
                "labels.label3" and populate the patch environment as
                follows:

                ::

                    {
                      "labels":{
                        "label1":"new-label1-value"
                        "label2":"new-label2-value"
                      }
                    }

                Note that in the above example, any existing labels that
                are not included in the ``updateMask`` will be
                unaffected.

                It is also possible to replace an entire map field by
                providing the map field's path in the ``updateMask``.
                The new value of the field will be that which is
                provided in the patch environment. For example, to
                delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and
                install botocore at version 1.7.14, the ``updateMask``
                would contain the path
                "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and the patch
                environment would be the following:

                ::

                    {
                      "config":{
                        "softwareConfig":{
                          "pypiPackages":{
                            "botocore":"==1.7.14"
                          }
                        }
                      }
                    }

                **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated:

                -  ``config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages``

                      and a mask specifying an individual package.

                   -  Update the custom PyPI package *packagename*,
                      preserving other packages. To delete the package,
                      include it in ``updateMask``, and omit the mapping
                      for it in

                      mask.

                -  ``labels``

                   -  Replace all environment labels. If a replacement
                      labels map is not included in ``environment``, all
                      labels are cleared. It is an error to provide both

                      individual labels.

                -  ``labels.``\ labelName

                   -  Set the label named *labelName*, while preserving
                      other labels. To delete the label, include it in
                      ``updateMask`` and omit its mapping in

                   -  Replace the environment's current
                      ``WebServerNetworkAccessControl``.

                -  ``config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides``

                   -  Replace all Apache Airflow config overrides. If a
                      replacement config overrides map is not included
                      in ``environment``, all config overrides are
                      cleared. It is an error to provide both this mask
                      and a mask specifying one or more individual
                      config overrides.

                -  ``config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides.``\ section-name

                   -  Override the Apache Airflow config property *name*
                      in the section named *section*, preserving other
                      properties. To delete the property override,
                      include it in ``updateMask`` and omit its mapping
                      in

                      mask.

                -  ``config.softwareConfig.envVariables``

                   -  Replace all environment variables. If a
                      replacement environment variable map is not
                      included in ``environment``, all custom
                      environment variables are cleared.

                -  ``config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount``

                   -  Horizontally scale the number of schedulers in
                      Airflow. A positive integer not greater than the
                      number of nodes must be provided in the
                      ``config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount`` field.
                      Supported for Cloud Composer environments in
                      versions composer-1.\ *.*-airflow-2.*.*.

                -  ``config.databaseConfig.machineType``

                   -  Cloud SQL machine type used by Airflow database.
                      It has to be one of: db-n1-standard-2,
                      db-n1-standard-4, db-n1-standard-8 or

                This corresponds to the ``update_mask`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
